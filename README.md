Welcome to the Pixel Adventure Server!

No need for the official version, offline access available. Whether you have the official Minecraft or not, you can join us and enjoy the game anytime, anywhere.

Minimal plugins and mods, maintaining original balance. We've only used a few plugins and mods to ensure the gameplay is similar to the original version, while adding some auxiliary functions to make the game more convenient.

Completely free, no microtransactions, no recharge. The server does not provide any paid services, and all players can play for free.

Relaxed rules, freedom to explore. We encourage players to freely explore and create, but please follow the basic rules: no cheating, no destroying others' buildings. Here, you can fully unleash your creativity.

- **Client Version:** Minecraft Java 1.20.1
